= Breaking the Ice

Alternate title: Leveraging Anxiety to Overcome Anxiety

Thanks to the graciousness of friends, about a month ago I was able to attend the #ML4ALL conference in Portland (which, by the way, was excellent). It had been almost ten years since I was last at a community-organized conference in this city and just about that long since I last stepped into a new tech community. Back in 2008, I was hacking on the open-source database project
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzle_(database_server)[Drizzle]... these days, I'm diving into TensorFlow and Keras.

So, there I was, waiting in the lunch line in a dark room and trying to make small talk, as one does ... but feeling shy and anxious since I didn't know anyone at the conference. OpenStack didn't seem relevant to this crowd, and I was [and still am] new to the field of ML, so I was having trouble even thinking of small talk. To make social anxiety worse, I don't spend a lot of time in Portland so I didn't even have local/current events to draw on... And then, like someone dropping a beer can on my foot, it dawned on me...

_I'm already feeling anxious, like I do before a talk. Maybe if I get on stage, I'll feel *less* awkward afterwards!_

With lunch halfway over, I grabbed a little food and hurried over to sign up for a lighting talk -- slated for immediately after lunch. Nothing like a short deadline to inspire some writing! I decided that the best thing I could ramble about (since I couldn't create a great slide deck in 30 minutes) was this side project I'd started at a Madrona Labs GoVertical event a month before, trying to use LANDSAT images to predict where wildfires will break out.

The real message of the talk? Don't forget that Machine Learning can [and should] be used for social good, too, and there are huge public data sets out there you can draw from.

And  it worked!  I felt less anxious after I got off stage.
