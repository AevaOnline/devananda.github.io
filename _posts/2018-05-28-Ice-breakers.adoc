Today is Memorial Day, and thanks to the graciousness of friends, I found
myself with a free ticket to the #ML4ALL conference in Portland. It has been
almost ten years since I was at a community-organized conference in this city
and about that long since I stepped into a new tech community. Last time, it
was open-source databases like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzle_(database_server)[Drizzle], which led me
to cloud computing; this time, it's Machine Learning.

In a dark room with a few hundred people I didn't know, I stood in the lunch
line trying to make small talk and feeling shy and anxious, wishing I could
share with everyone the cool things I've been trying to do lately. If only there
was some way to get over the awkwardness of talking to strangers ....

_Oh wait. That's what a stage is for!_

So, with lunch halfway over, I signed up for a lighting talk (scheduled for
right after lunch), and decided that the best thing I could ramble about (from
the point of view of an unexpecting audience, I hoped) would be to try and
inspire social change and share the FireWise project that I am part of. TL;DR
we're trying to use public data sets (sattelite imagery) to predict where
wildfires will occur.

You'll find the slides here: (link coming soon)
