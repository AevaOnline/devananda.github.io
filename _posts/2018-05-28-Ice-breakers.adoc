= Ice breakers

Today is Memorial Day, and through a series of events I find myself at the #ML4ALL conference in Portland. It's been almost ten years since I was at a community-organized conference in this city, and that long since I stepped into a new tech community. Last time, it was open-source databases (which led me to cloud computing). This time, it's Machine Learning.

So, here I am, in a dark room with a few hundred people I don't know, in the lunch line trying to make small talk and wishing I could share with everyone the cool things I've been trying to do lately. If only there was some way to get over the awkwardness of talking to strangers ....

Oh wait.

That's what a stage is for!

So, with lunch halfway over, I signed up for a lighting talk (scheduled for right after lunch), and decided that the best thing I could ramble about (from the point of view of an unexpecting audience, I hoped) would be to try and inspire social change and share the FireWise project that I am part of. TL;DR we're trying to use public data sets (sattelite imagery) to predict where wildfires will occur. 

You'll find the slides here: (link coming soon)

Sure enough, I felt a lot less awkward after the talk (and after the adrenaline wore off!).
